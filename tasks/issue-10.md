# Task: Frontend: Add tooltip to Submit button

## Source
- GitHub Issue: https://github.com/adityasudhakar/number-adder/issues/10

## Context
Please add a tooltip to the Submit button explaining what it does. Keep it simple.

## Acceptance Criteria (must be testable)
- [ ] (fill in)

## Test selection guide
Pick the cheapest test that proves the change:

1) **Backend unit/service tests (pytest)**: business logic, helpers.
2) **Backend API contract tests (pytest + FastAPI TestClient)**: endpoints, validation, responses.
3) **Frontend component tests (Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library)**: UI behavior (if web frontend exists).
4) **E2E smoke (Playwright)**: only for critical cross-stack flows.

## How to test locally
- Backend: `python -m pytest`
- Frontend (if applicable): `npm test`

## Notes / Constraints
- Keep PR small and focused.
- If acceptance criteria can’t be tested, mark task as blocked and explain why.
